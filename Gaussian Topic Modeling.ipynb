       "'Well, I just got my Centris 610 yesterday.  It took just over two \\nweeks from placing the order.  The dealer (Rutgers computer store) \\nappologized because Apple made a substitution on my order.  I ordered\\nthe one without ethernet, but they substituted one _with_ ethernet.\\nHe wanted to know if that would be \"alright with me\"!!!  They must\\nbe backlogged on Centri w/out ethernet so they\\'re just shipping them\\nwith!  \\n\\n\\tAnyway, I\\'m very happy with the 610 with a few exceptions.  \\nBeing nosy, I decided to open it up _before_ powering it on for the first\\ntime.  The SCSI cable to the hard drive was only partially connected\\n(must have come loose in shipping).  No big deal, but I would have been\\npissed if I tried to boot it and it wouldn\\'t come up!\\n\\tThe hard drive also has an annoying high pitched whine.  I\\'ve\\nheard apple will exchange it if you complain, so I might try to get\\nit swapped.\\n\\tI am also dissappionted by the lack of soft power-on/off.  This\\nwasn\\'t mentioned in any of the literature I saw.  Also, the location\\nof the reset/interupt buttons is awful.  Having keyboard control for\\nthese functions was much more convenient.\\n\\tOh, and the screen seems tojump in a wierd way on power-up.\\nI\\'ve seen this mentioned by others, so it must be a...feature...\\n\\tAnyway, above all, it\\'s fast.  A great machine at a great price!'"
